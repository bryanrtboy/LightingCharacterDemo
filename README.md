# LightingCharacterDemo
This Unity project is a starting point for a demonstration on lighting in Unity. In order to really understand the effects of lighting a scene, it's helpful to have a character that can move to different points of a scene to see how light changes in 3D space. Therefore, this project contains a third-person character from the Unity [Mecanim Example Scene](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/mecanim-example-scenes-5328).

Bonus feature! Also included is a quick Kingpin style model, in FBX and C4D format to demonstrate importing fbx features and retargeting humanoid animation systems like that found in the example scene.

Covered in the live demo:
* Changing from Gamma to Linear lighting (Linear is required if you are using PostProcessing effects)
* Import settings to generate Lightmap UVs
* Marking objects static for lightmapping
* Adding static and mixed lights to a scene
* Adding lighting probes
* Adjusting Light settings for baking lightmaps

Bonus items!
* Swapping out the player for Kingpin
* Adjusting Kingpin's size in the scene
* Figuring out how to make adjustments to the third person camera rig
